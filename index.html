<ul>
<li><a>This game began as a two person class project that would take approximately a month; however, my partner had to drop the class 9 days into the project. They were able to make the initial system for swinging the sword and debug system to destroy enemies on hit, but I completed the rest of the systems myself. These systems include, character movement, basic AI, equipment, room transitioning, inventory, sound, and graphics. </a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><a>I did not create most of the initial map, art, or sound. The initial map for the dungeon 1 was provided to me from the class, art and sound was aquired from thevgresource website, and the background music was taken from videogame music preservation foundation.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><a>The technology used in this project include, unity 2022.3.43f1, 2019 Microsoft Visual Studio, github desktop + github, and the programming language C Sharp. </a></li>
